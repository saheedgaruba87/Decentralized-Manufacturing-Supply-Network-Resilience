# Tokenized Healthcare Value-Based Payment System

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes healthcare payment models by implementing a transparent, secure, and efficient value-based care (VBC) system. By tokenizing the healthcare payment process, we create an immutable record of provider performance, patient attribution, quality metrics, and cost data that enables automatic, fair adjustments to reimbursements based on the actual value delivered to patients.

## Core Components

The system consists of five primary smart contracts that form a comprehensive healthcare value-based payment infrastructure:

### 1. Provider Verification Contract
- Validates and registers legitimate healthcare entities (hospitals, clinics, physicians)
- Maintains credentials, specialties, and network affiliations
- Implements multi-level verification processes including license validation
- Manages provider reputation scores based on quality and cost performance
- Controls access permissions to different features of the platform

### 2. Patient Attribution Contract
- Securely assigns patients to appropriate providers or care teams
- Implements privacy-preserving mechanisms for patient data
- Tracks patient-provider relationships over time
- Handles changes in attribution (patient relocations, provider changes)
- Supports various attribution models (geographic, claims-based, patient selection)

### 3. Quality Measurement Contract
- Tracks clinical performance metrics across multiple domains
- Implements standardized quality measures (HEDIS, MIPS, etc.)
- Supports custom quality metrics specific to specialties
- Enables risk-adjustment for fair provider comparison
- Provides auditable verification of reported metrics

### 4. Cost Tracking Contract
- Records all healthcare expenditures associated with attributed patients
- Categorizes costs by service type, setting, and clinical category
- Implements risk adjustment mechanisms for fair cost comparisons
- Identifies cost outliers and variation patterns
- Tracks resource utilization efficiency metrics

### 5. Payment Adjustment Contract
- Calculates performance-based modifications to base reimbursement rates
- Implements shared savings distribution mechanisms
- Automates bonus payments and penalties based on quality and cost metrics
- Handles bundled payment reconciliation
- Provides transparent audit trails for all payment adjustments

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Built on a permissioned enterprise blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric or Enterprise Ethereum)
- Implements HIPAA-compliant data storage and transmission
- Uses zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive health information
- Supports high transaction throughput for large healthcare networks

### Security Features
- Healthcare-specific identity and access management
- Advanced encryption for protected health information (PHI)
- Separation of identifiable and clinical data
- Regular compliance audits and vulnerability assessments
- Multi-signature approval for critical contract updates

### Integration Capabilities
- HL7 FHIR API compatibility for clinical data exchange
- Integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems
- Connectivity with claims processing and billing systems
- Interoperability with existing healthcare data warehouses
- Support for standard medical coding systems (ICD-10, CPT, SNOMED CT)

## Getting Started

cd tokenized-healthcare-vbp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your network settings

npm run compile
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to development environment
npm run deploy:dev

# Deploy to testing environment with simulated data
npm run deploy:test

npm run deploy:prod
```

## Usage

### Provider Registration and Verification
```javascript
// Example of registering a new healthcare provider
const ProviderVerification = artifacts.require("ProviderVerification");
const providerContract = await ProviderVerification.deployed();

await providerContract.registerProvider(
  "Provider Name",
  "NPI Number",
  "License Number",
  "Specialty Code",
  "Credentials Hash",
  { from: providerAdminAddress }
);

// Verification by authorized entity
await providerContract.verifyProvider(
  providerID,
  verificationDocumentHash,
  { from: networkAdminAddress }
);
```

### Patient Attribution
```javascript
// Example of attributing patients to providers
const PatientAttribution = artifacts.require("PatientAttribution");
const attributionContract = await PatientAttribution.deployed();

await attributionContract.attributePatient(
  patientHashedID,
  providerID,
  attributionReason,
  startDate,
  { from: authorizedAttributorAddress }
);
```

### Quality Reporting
```javascript
// Example of submitting quality metrics
const QualityMeasurement = artifacts.require("QualityMeasurement");
const qualityContract = await QualityMeasurement.deployed();

await qualityContract.submitMetric(
  providerID,
  measureID,
  reportingPeriod,
  numerator,
  denominator,
  supportingDocumentHash,
  { from: authorizedReporterAddress }
);
```

### Cost Data Submission
```javascript
// Example of recording healthcare costs
const CostTracking = artifacts.require("CostTracking");
const costContract = await CostTracking.deployed();

await costContract.recordCost(
  patientHashedID,
  providerID,
  serviceCategory,
  amount,
  serviceDate,
  claimHash,
  { from: authorizedFinancialEntity }
);
```

### Payment Adjustment
```javascript
// Example of calculating payment adjustments
const PaymentAdjustment = artifacts.require("PaymentAdjustment");
const paymentContract = await PaymentAdjustment.deployed();

await paymentContract.calculateAdjustment(
  providerID,
  performancePeriod,
  { from: networkAdminAddress }
);

// Retrieving adjustment information
const adjustment = await paymentContract.getAdjustmentDetails(
  providerID,
  performancePeriod
);
```

## Governance Model

The platform implements a consortium governance structure with representatives from:

1. Healthcare providers
2. Payer organizations
3. Patient advocacy groups
4. Regulatory compliance experts
5. Technical maintenance team

Key governance functions include:
- Approving changes to quality metrics and measurement methodologies
- Setting thresholds for payment adjustments
- Updating risk adjustment algorithms
- Resolving disputes between participants
- Ensuring compliance with evolving regulations

## Roadmap
