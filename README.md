# Decentralized Manufacturing Supply Network Resilience (DMSNR)

## Overview

DMSNR is a blockchain-powered platform designed to enhance manufacturing supply chain resilience through decentralized coordination, transparent risk management, and automated contingency activation. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the platform provides manufacturers and suppliers with a robust framework to anticipate, mitigate, and rapidly respond to supply chain disruptions while maintaining production continuity.

## Core Components

The system consists of five primary smart contracts that form a comprehensive supply chain resilience infrastructure:

### 1. Entity Verification Contract
- Validates the identity and credentials of all supply chain participants
- Implements tiered verification levels based on participant role and criticality
- Manages digital certificates and compliance documentation
- Maintains reputation scores based on historical performance
- Controls access permissions to different features of the platform
- Integrates with existing industry certification standards

### 2. Capacity Registration Contract
- Records detailed production capabilities of each manufacturing node
- Tracks available capacity, utilization levels, and production schedules
- Maintains specifications for equipment, materials, and processes
- Implements secure sharing of non-sensitive capacity information
- Updates capacity status in near real-time through IoT integration
- Identifies complementary capabilities across the network

### 3. Risk Assessment Contract
- Identifies and quantifies potential disruption factors across the supply network
- Implements risk scoring algorithms for geographic, geopolitical, and operational risks
- Tracks dependencies between suppliers, materials, and production processes
- Monitors external risk data through oracle integrations
- Provides simulation capabilities for scenario planning
- Generates automated risk alerts when thresholds are exceeded

### 4. Alternative Sourcing Contract
- Manages a database of qualified backup suppliers for critical components
- Facilitates rapid supplier discovery based on capability matching
- Implements pre-negotiated contingency agreements with standby activation
- Manages qualification and onboarding processes for backup suppliers
- Tracks testing and validation of alternative materials and components
- Provides cost impact analysis for alternative sourcing decisions

### 5. Disruption Response Contract
- Coordinates real-time supply chain adjustments during disruption events
- Implements automated triggering of contingency plans based on predefined conditions
- Manages priority allocation of constrained resources
- Coordinates logistics rerouting and production schedule adjustments
- Tracks recovery metrics and progress toward normal operations
- Documents lessons learned and updates response protocols

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Infrastructure
- Built on an enterprise-grade permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric or Corda)
- Implements secure multi-party computation for sensitive capacity data
- Uses distributed file storage for technical specifications and certifications
- Supports high transaction throughput for real-time supply chain events
- Leverages smart contract-based business logic for automated response execution

### Security Features
- Fine-grained access control based on organizational role
- Zero-knowledge proofs for preserving competitive information
- Multi-signature approvals for critical response actions
- Encryption of sensitive production and capacity data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Integration Capabilities
- APIs for ERP and MES systems integration
- IoT device connectivity for real-time production monitoring
- Data exchange protocols with logistics management systems
- Integration with weather, geopolitical, and market risk data feeds
- Compatibility with industry standard EDI formats

## Usage

### Entity Registration and Verification
```javascript

const entityContract = await EntityVerification.deployed();

await entityContract.registerEntity(
  "Manufacturer Name",
  "Manufacturing",
  "DUNS Number",
  "Company Registration Hash",
  locationData,
  { from: entityAdminAddress }
);

// Verification by authorized industry validator
await entityContract.verifyEntity(
  entityID,
  verificationLevel,
  verificationDocumentHash,
  expirationDate,
  { from: networkValidatorAddress }
);
```

### Capacity Registration
```javascript
// Example of registering production capacity
const CapacityRegistration = artifacts.require("CapacityRegistration");
const capacityContract = await CapacityRegistration.deployed();

await capacityContract.registerCapacity(
  entityID,
  facilityID,
  productionLineID,
  capabilityCategories,
  maxCapacity,
  currentUtilization,
  equipmentSpecificationsHash,
  { from: authorizedEntityAddress }
);

// Update current capacity utilization
await capacityContract.updateUtilization(
  facilityID,
  productionLineID,
  currentUtilization,
  availableCapacity,
  maintenanceStatus,
  { from: authorizedEntityAddress }
);
```

### Risk Assessment
```javascript
// Example of registering a supply chain risk
const RiskAssessment = artifacts.require("RiskAssessment");
const riskContract = await RiskAssessment.deployed();

await riskContract.registerRisk(
  entityID,
  riskCategory,
  riskDescription,
  impactLevel,
  probabilityScore,
  affectedComponents,
  mitigationMeasuresHash,
  { from: authorizedRiskManager }

// Conduct network-wide risk analysis
await riskContract.analyzeNetworkRisks(
  supplyChainID,
  analysisParameters,
  { from: networkAdminAddress }
);
```
